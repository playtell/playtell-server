	<p style="width: 500px">The seasons were changing on the Island of Sodor. The leaves had begun to change color, and the air was growing crisp. Thomas the Tank Engine was feeling restless.</p>
	<p style="width: 500px">"Summer is almost over, and I haven't had any real fun," he complained.</p> 
	<p style="width: 500px">"You're a fussy little engine," replied Gordon. "We're not here to have fun. We're here to work."</p>
	<p style="width: 500px">Well, that didn't make Thomas feel any better.</p>
	<p style="width: 500px">"I'd rather be fussy and fun than bossy and boring!" he retorted.</p>
