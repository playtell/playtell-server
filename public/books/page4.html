<p>The seasons were changing on the Island of Sodor. The leaves had begun to change color, and the air was growing crisp. Thomas the Tank Engine was feeling restless.</p>
<p>"Summer is almost over, and I haven't had any real fun," he complained.</p> 
<p>"You're a fussy little engine," replied Gordon. "We're not here to have fun. We're here to work."</p>
<p>Well, that didn't make Thomas feel any better.</p>
<p>"I'd rather be fussy and fun than bossy and boring!" he retorted.</p>
