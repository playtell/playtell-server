Hi <%= @invitee.username.capitalize %>, 

<%= @inviter.username.capitalize %> just signed up for the PlayTell alpha, and got you in too :) PlayTell lets you read and play with your loved ones while you're apart.

Here are the 3 easy steps to get the PlayTell iPad app: 

1. On your iPad, open Safari and go to <%= url_for 'www.playtell.com/ipad' %>

2. Login with your new account:
Email: <%= @invitee.email %>
Password: rg

3. Click the first button and follow the steps to install; then click the second button to install the app. 

Once you've done your first PlayTell playdate, we'd love to hear what you think. 

Thanks!
Semira & Jason
