Hi <%= @invitee.username.capitalize %>, 

<%= @inviter.username.capitalize %> just signed up for the PlayTell beta, and got you in too :) PlayTell lets you read and play with your loved ones while you're apart.

To get you the PlayTell app we need some information about your iPad. Guess what, there is an app for that!

Step #1: From your iPad, click on the link below and install and then run the app (it's free).
<%= url_for 'http://itunes.apple.com/app/ad-hoc-helper/id285691333?mt=8' %>

Step #2: This app will create an email. Please send it to jason@playtell.com

Once we've received that email, we'll send you a link to download the PlayTell app. 

Thanks!
Semira & Jason
