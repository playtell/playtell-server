Hi <%= @invitee.username %>, 

<%= @inviter.username %> just signed up for the PlayTell beta, and got you in too :) PlayTell lets you connect with, read, and play with your loved ones while you're apart.

To get the PlayTell app on your iPad we need some information about your iPad. Guess what, there is an app for that!

Step #1: Click on the link below and install and then run the app (it's free).

Step #2: This app will create an email. Please send it to me: semira@playtell.com

Once we've received that email, we'll send you a link to download the app. 

Thanks!
Semira & Jason
